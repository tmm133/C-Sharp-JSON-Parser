# C-Sharp-JSON-Parser

To use this, downoload the .exe file.  When executing the file, type in the full path of the file, and the full path of the JSON 
that you want to parse.

I've included two .cs files that creat the .exe.  The JSON_Classes.cs contains all the classes used to hold the JSON objects, and the 
JSON_Parser.cs file is the main program that contains the algorithm to parse the JSON string.

Lastley, I've included two JSON string files for testing.  The first is json.json which contains a JSON string from reddit.com.  The second
file JSONJSON.txt is a sample JSON string from JSON.org.
